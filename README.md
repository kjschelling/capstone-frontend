Beauty Cosemetic Ingredient Site - Frontend 

I created this site to aid me in my research of cosemetic ingredients. Giving me
a place to store ingredients I'm interested in. Along with adding ingredients, 
it allows me to add relevant links and additional notes to each ingredient.

Planning:

-First I mapped out my ERD and user stories
-Next I set up both backend and frontend and deployed both
-then I started working on my api getting the first resource created and functioning
before I moved to the front end to set up the resource and get it to show and create
- next I created the second resource in the backend then moved to the front end to finish
all the crud functions for all the resources
-then added finishing touches.

Things I was improve:
-add a search bar
-better styling
-favorites resource
