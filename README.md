Welcome to my Cosemetic Ingredient Site.

This site allows the user to log in, add an ingredient they want to know more
about and add links and notes desribing what it's used for, research paper links,
and any other useful resources.

I created this site to aid me in my research of cosemetic ingredients. It gives me
a place to store ingredients I'm interested in and can add links and notes to each.
