Front end Capstone
Welcome to my Cosemetic Ingredient Site.

This site allows the user to log in, add an ingredient they want to know more
about and add links and notes desribing what it's used for, research paper links,
and any other useful resources.

I created this site to aid me in my research of cosemetic ingredients. It gives me
a place to store ingredients I'm interested in and can add links and notes to each.

User Stories:

-User should sign up, sign in, change password and sign out
-user should be able to view, create and delete an ingredient
-user should be able to view create, update and delete ingredients additional info



Technologies used:
-Rails
-Ember.js
-Heroku
-CSSgit push  and Sass
-HTML

Things I was improve:
-add a search bar
-better styling
-favorites resource

Planning:

-First I mapped out my ERD and user stories
-Next I set up both backend and frontend and deployed both
-then I started working on my api getting the first resource created and functioning
before I moved to the front end to set up the resource and get it to show and create
- next I created the second resource in the backend then moved to the front end to finish
all the crud functions for all the resources
-then added finishing touches.
